## Problem Statement

*Regional imbalance is driven by the concentration of qualified jobs, education opportunities, and investments in a few metropolitan areas.*

### Key Effects
- Urban overcrowding (housing + infrastructure stress)
- Quality of life decline (traffic, time loss, cost)
- Talent drain from smaller cities
- Reduced local economic diversity

### Why it’s hard
- Migration is often not a preference but a necessity
- Investments follow talent concentration
- Results require long-term policy consistency
