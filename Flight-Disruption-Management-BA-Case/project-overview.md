### 📈 Business Value Summary

Managing flight delays is one of the most complex operational challenges in aviation.
This case study delivers measurable business value by improving passenger experience, operational stability, and overall efficiency.

🎯 1. Operational Efficiency

Faster and more accurate disruption handling

Reduced gate conflicts and aircraft rotation issues

Improved crew legality recalculations

Lower likelihood of cascading delays
→ Result: Higher on-time performance (OTP)

🧭 2. Passenger Experience Improvement

Clear, timely, and personalized notifications

Predictable disruption-handling flow

Rebooking options shown instantly

Fewer complaints and call center load
→ Result: Better customer satisfaction (NPS ↑)

💰 3. Cost Reduction

Reduced misconnected baggage and rerouting cost

Fewer hotel/meal compensations due to proactive communication

Minimization of aircraft/crew inefficiency
→ Result: Operational cost savings

🔄 4. System Reliability

Standardized event-driven architecture for disruption updates

Cleaner data flow between OCC, airport operations, crew, and passenger systems

Lower manual workload and human error
→ Result: More predictable and stable system interactions

🚀 5. Strategic Value

Scalable model for integrating AI-driven prediction systems (ETA/ETD forecasting, crew legality prediction)

Can be adapted for irregular operations (IRROPS) like weather, maintenance issues, or ATC restrictions
→ Result: Future-ready operational framework

📌 TL;DR — Why This Project Matters

This analysis shows how structured flight disruption management reduces passenger impact, prevents operational chaos, and saves cost — while making airline operations more predictable and scalable.
