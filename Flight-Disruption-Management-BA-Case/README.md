# ✈️ Flight Disruption Management — Business Analysis Case Study
*A sector-focused project analyzing one of the most critical operational & technical processes in aviation: Flight Disruption Management.*

In aviation, even a **5-minute delay** can impact:
- hundreds of passengers,
- dozens of operational teams,
- real-time data systems,
- airport coordination,
- baggage routing,
- crew planning and aircraft assignments.

This project explores the **end-to-end flow** of managing flight delays from a **Business Analyst** perspective, including:

### 🔹 Passenger communication (SMS / Push / E-mail)
### 🔹 Flight re-scheduling & OCC decision making
### 🔹 Crew – aircraft – gate assignment logic
### 🔹 Baggage handling system impact (BHS / BRS)
### 🔹 Airport operations coordination
### 🔹 Alternative scenarios & edge cases
