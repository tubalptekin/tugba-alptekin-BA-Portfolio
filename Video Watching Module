##📺 Video Watching Module – Business Analysis

The Video Watching Module is a core feature of an e-learning platform that enables users to watch videos, track their progress, and seamlessly continue where they left off.
This analysis focuses on user behavior, progress tracking, and the “Continue Watching” experience.

⭐ 1. Overview

This module covers how users interact with video content, how the system saves their progress, and how previously watched videos are retrieved.
It also defines the logic behind the Continue Watching modal and user experience improvements.

⭐ 2. User Stories

As a user, I want to watch a selected video so that I can follow the lesson or content.

US-02 – Auto-Save Progress

As a user, I want the system to automatically save my progress so I don’t lose my place.

US-03 – Continue Watching

As a user, I want to continue a video from where I left off so I don’t have to search manually.

US-04 – View Recently Watched Videos

As a user, I want to see my last watched videos so I can easily return to ongoing lessons.

US-05 – Completion Tracking

As a user, I want videos to be marked as completed so I can track my learning progress.

⭐ 3. Acceptance Criteria

#AC – Auto Save Progress

Progress is saved every 10 seconds.

Progress is saved when the user closes or pauses the video.

Progress updates instantly when the user seeks the timeline.

Timestamp is stored in the user profile data.
